If you’re from EEA or UK, when we transfer your Personal Information out of EEA or UK, we will comply with applicable EEA/UK data protection laws and take appropriate measures to safeguard security of your Personal Information. For example, we may transfer your Personal Information to countries which have been found to provide adequate protection by the EU Commission (e.g. Switzerland and Canada) to process and store your Personal Information, or we may use contractual protections for the transfer of your Personal Information to regions which haven’t been found to provide adequate protection by the EU Commission. You may contact us as specified below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer your Personal Information outside of EEA or UK.<br/>
9. Data Retention<br/>

If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. If the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.

24.	 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration<br/>
24.1.  Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Agora in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, and except as described in Section 24.2, you and Agora agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.<br/>
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND AGORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br/>
24.2.  Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 24.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br/>
24.3 If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 24 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Agora, Inc., Attention: Arbitration Opt-Out, 2804 Mission College Blvd, Suite 110, Santa Clara, CA 95054 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Agora receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 24 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 24.3. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. <br/>
24.4 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Agora will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Agora. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br/>
24.5. Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Agora’s address for Notice is: Agora, Inc., 2804 Mission College Blvd, Suite 110, Santa Clara, CA 95054. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Agora may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Agora must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Agora in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Agora will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $1,000.<br/>
24.6.  Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Agora will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Agora for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<br/>
24.7.  No Class Actions. YOU AND AGORA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Agora agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br/>
24.8.  Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Agora makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Agora’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Agora’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Agora will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br/>
24.9.  Enforceability. If Section 24.7 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25.3 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.<br/>
25.	 Miscellaneous<br/>
25.1.  General. These Terms govern your use of the Website, Platform and the Service and constitute the entire agreement between you and Agora regarding the subject matter hereof. These Terms supersede any prior agreements between you and Agora relating to your use of the Website, Platform and the Service (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms). The failure of Agora to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision, and a waiver of any default is not a waiver of any other default. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, the provision shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the parties’ original intentions as reflected in the provision, and so that the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. All headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The Terms are personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of control involving you) without Agora’s prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. Agora expressly reserves and shall have the right to assign the Terms and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.<br/>
25.2.  Notices. We may send you any notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, to the email address you provided when you requested your API key or through any other reasonable means. Any notices to Agora must be sent to Agora Lab, 2804 Mission College Blvd. Ste. 110, Santa Clara, CA  95054 via first class or air mail or overnight courier and are deemed given upon receipt.<br/>
25.3.  Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts sitting in Santa Clara County, California or the federal courts in the Northern District of California to resolve any disputes arising under these Terms. In each case these Terms shall be construed and enforced without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.<br/>
